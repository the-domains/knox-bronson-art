A. I was born in Oakland, California on November 10, 1950\. I was five weeks premature and put in an incubator. At one point, the doctors told my parents I would not make it.
I was precocious, fearless, and hyper-active as a child. I climbed everything in sight. From kindergarten through the third grade, I came home every day and put on my Zorro mask, hat, and cape, and ran around the neighborhood with my sword. I would wander far away even at the age of five, exploring the open areas around our house.
